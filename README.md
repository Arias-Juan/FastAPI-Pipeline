This architecture is looking to resolve the next steps:

3. Be able to insert batch transactions (1 up to 1000 rows) with one reques

To consider the project were:
* Hosted in AWS Cloud, utilizing services like EC2 and S3 to minimize costs
* The api script were tested by Postman
* The project can be deployed by Docker with the Dockerfile in the repository
* The DB is public and can be access in any database management tool (eg. Dbeaver)
* All the scripts are updated one time in a day from this GitHub repository
